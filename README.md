# Pomoro-Ducky: Your Smart Productivity Companion

**Pomoro-Ducky** is an interactive, microcontroller-based smart timer designed to boost productivity using the Pomodoro technique. Combined with a physical duck companion, it provides audio feedback, bedlamp features, and a "lo-fi" study atmosphere.

This project is currently being developed as an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** for the **OPSI (National Student Research Olympiad)** and is open for collaboration through the Github Solvearn internship program and any Social media.

## ✨ Features
- **Smart Pomodoro Logic:** 25m focus + 5m break (Auto-rest after 4 cycles).
- **Interactive Audio:** Real-time "Quacks", task reminders, and advice every 15 minutes.
- **Lo-Fi Study Mode:** Integrated music player for deep work.
- **Physical Interaction:** Dual-button control (Duck's foot & head) and integrated bedlamp.
- **Real-Time Clock:** Precise timing with DS1302 integration.

## Tech Stack
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 / Arduino (TBD)
- **Audio:** DFPlayer Mini + 8GB MicroSD
- **Clock:** RTC DS1302
- **Peripheral:** 8ohm Speaker, Latching Buttons, LED Bedlamp.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Phase 1: Logic Simulation (Wokwi/Proteus)
- [ ] Phase 2: Firmware Development (Firmware integration with RTC & Audio)
- [ ] Phase 3: Hardware Prototyping & PCB Design
- [ ] Phase 4: OPSI Competition Submission
- [ ] Phase 5: Mass Production Research

## Collaboration
This project is open-source, but we are looking for a **Core Team** for:
1. **Embedded Programmer:** Logic & Firmware.
2. **Hardware Engineer:** PCB Design & Circuitry.
